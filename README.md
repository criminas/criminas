# Contributing to Criminas

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Criminas! We are a community-driven organization building open source tools for a freer, more secure web. Your contributions help make that vision a reality.

This guide applies to all repositories under the Criminas organization, including our website, CLI tools, core infrastructure, and security projects.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. We expect all contributors to be respectful, constructive, and inclusive in their interactions.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Bug Reports & Security

If you find a bug, please search the project's issue tracker first. If it's a new issue, open a report with:
- A descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, version, etc.)

**Security Vulnerabilities:** Please do not report security vulnerabilities via public issues. Instead, email us directly at [security@criminas.org](mailto:security@criminas.org).

### Feature Requests

We love new ideas! If you have a suggestion:
- Check if it's been proposed before.
- Open an issue describing the "Why" and "How".
- Explain the problem it solves for users.

### Documentation & Translations

Good documentation is as important as good code. We welcome improvements to our guides, READMEs, and API references. If you're multilingual, help us reach more people by translating our documentation.

### Code Contributions

1. **Find an Issue**: Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` tags.
2. **Fork & Clone**: Pull the code to your local environment.
3. **Branch**: Create a descriptive branch (e.g., `feature/secure-handshake`).
4. **Code**: Write clear, documented code. Ensure you follow the project's specific style guide.
5. **Test**: Never submit a PR without tests. Ensure all existing tests pass.
6. **PR**: Open a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes.

## Development Ecosystem

Criminas uses a variety of technologies depending on the project's goals:

- **Web**: Astro, TypeScript, Vanilla CSS
- **Core Systems**: Go, Rust, C++
- **Security Tools**: Python, Go
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes

### Project-Specific Setup

Since each project has its own environment, please always refer to the **`README.md`** or **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** file within the specific repository for setup instructions, build commands, and testing procedures.

## Style & Quality Standards

- **Consistency**: Follow the linter and formatter settings defined in the project (e.g., `rustfmt`, `gofmt`, `prettier`).
- **Simplicity**: We value clean, readable code over clever hacks.
- **Testing**: We aim for high test coverage. New features must include unit and/or integration tests.
- **Documentation**: New code should be self-documenting, and public APIs must have clear comments.

## Community
